He was expelled from school at aged 15.[2] He has claimed that drug use was the reason for\\nexpulsion, a lthough R itchie\\'s father said he was \"cutting class and entertaining a girl in his room\".[7]\\nAfter his first project on a short film, The Hard Case (1995), in 1998, Ritchie met Matthew Vaughn ,\\ngodson of Peter Morton, co-founde r of the Hard Rock Cafe chain. Vaughn had been working in Los\\nAngeles and expressed interest in produc ing Ritchie\\'s directorial debut, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking\\nBarrels (1998). It took 15 months to secure financial backing.[8][9] Trudie Styler served as an executive\\nproduc er—she said \"I\\'ve always liked bad-boy m ovies\".[10]\\nThe produc tion of\\ncomedy heist film Lock,\\nStock and Two Smoking\\nBarrels was completed in\\nabout eight months.\\nStarring Nick Moran,\\nJason Statham, Jason\\nFlemyng and Dexter\\nFletcher, the film exposed\\nthem to worldwide\\naudiences, and launched\\nthe acting career of\\nformer footballer Vinnie\\nJones.

Snatch was released on 23 August 2000 to a commercial success at the box office,\\ngrossing more than $83 million worldwide.[16] Mick LaSalle, writing for San Francisco Chronicle, was\\nimpressed with Ritchie\\'s directing and \"sequences that discharge with energy\", but felt the writing could\\nhave been better.[17] Film critic Roger Ebert describes Ritchie as a \"zany, high-energy director\" but felt the\\nfilm\\'s plot \"doesn\\'t build and it doesn\\'t arrive anywhere\".[18]\\nIn 2001, Ritchie directed a music video for \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\", a song performed by Madonna ,\\nto whom Ritchie was married at the time.

The film was a critical and commercial failure, with an average rating of 5% on film\\nreview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.[21][22] Almar Haflidason of the BBC was critical of the lead actors,\\nwriting, \"[Madonna ] has neither good comedic sense nor any warmth [...] as for Giannini, he spends the\\nfirst half of the movie endlessly complaining like some old fishwife\".[23] The feature won five awards at\\nthe 2002 Golden Raspberry Awards for Worst Picture, Worst Actress, Worst Screen Couple, Worst Remake\\nor Sequel and Worst Director.[24][25]\\nIn 2002, R itchie conceived a prank show titled Swag, for Channel 5 in the United Kingdom .[26]\\nAfter a two-year hiatus, Ritchie returned to directing his next heist\\nfilm. Revolver (2005), starred Jason Statham, it was their third\\ncollaboration. Also cast were Ray Liotta, Vincent Pastore and\\nAndré Benjamin. The story is about a gambler called Jake Green\\n(Statham), who is released from prison and seeks revenge on those\\nwho stole his money. Filming was completed in late 2004 and the\\nfilm premiered at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival.[27]\\nRevolver was released in the United Kingdom  on 22 September\\n2005;  the film was critically panned and a commercial failure.\\nSimon Guerrier of FilmFocus, gave Revolver 1 out of 5 stars,\\ncalling it, \"tedious, humourless, pretentious and nasty\".[28] Adrian\\nHennigan from the BBC wrote, \"the cheeky charm [of his previous\\nfilms] has been replaced by plodding pretentiousness in a film that\\'s\\nilluminated by great action set-pieces and some powerful\\nperformances, but not redeemed\".[29] Ritchie responde d to the criticism by stating, \"I don\\'t think anything\\nwent wrong with Revolver. By its very nature it\\'s an esoteric movie. It\\'s not designed for the masses\".[30]\\nBudge ted at $27 million, the film earned $7.1 million at the worldwide box office.[31] In 2007, Revolver\\nwas re-edited and released for the United States.[32]\\nIn 2008, Ritchie directed RocknRolla, for which he also wrote the screenplay. Set in London, it tells the\\nstory of a crew of gangsters, a rock star and some powerful players, all conne cted to each other throughout\\nthe film.

RocknRolla was released on 5 September 2008 in the United Kingdom , reaching number\\none at the UK box office in its first week of release.[33] It was generally well received; Rotten Tomatoes\\ngave the film a 60% rating, stating, \"Mixed reviews for Guy Ritchie\\'s return to his London- based cockney\\nwideboy gangster movie roots, but most agree, it\\'s a step in the right direction following two major\\nturkeys\".[34] In that same year, Ritchie directed a television commercial for Nike called \"Take It To The\\nNext Level\", about a young Dutch footballer who signs for Arsenal, showing the progression of his career\\nfrom the beginning, through to his debut for the Netherlands. The commercial includes appearances from\\nCristiano R onaldo, Cesc Fàbregas, Ronaldinho, Wayne Roone y, and Ruud va n Nistelrooy.[35]\\nRitchie\\'s next directorial effort was Sherlock Holmes (2009) , based on the character of the same name\\ncreated by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Starring Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law, the film was released on 25\\nand 26 December 2009 in the United States and United Kingdom , respectively.

Released\\non 16 D ecember, the film was a commercial success, grossing m ore than $545 m illion w orldwide.[40] A. O.\\nScott of The New York Times praised Ritchie for \"taking liberties\" with the characters, and writes that both\\nfilms depict \"a smoky, overcast Victorian world, infuses it with an air of jocular, hairy laddishness and\\nstages a lot of fights in fussy and tiresome slow motion\".[41]\\nIn 2012, Ritchie produced a trailer for the video game Call of Duty: Black\\nOps II.[42] In 2013, he directed a commercial for H&M featuring David\\nBeckham.[43] A year later, he directed a commercial for whisky brand\\nHaig, which also stars Beckham.[44] He made a return to film in 2015, with\\nThe Man From U.N.C.L.E., a remake of the 1960s  spy series of the same\\nname.

However, he praised Hugh Grant\\'s\\nperformance which \"saves the movie\".[49]\\nIn January 2014, Warner Bros. hired Ritchie to direct the first of six films in a franchise, fantasy adventure\\nKing Arthur: Legend of the Sword (2017) with Charlie Hunnam portraying King Arthur.[50][51] The feature\\nwas released in 2D and 3D on 12 May 2017 in the United States, and a week later in the United Kingdom .\\nDespite high expectations from the film studio, it was a box-office failure, causing large financial losses for\\nWarner Bros. and Village Roadshow Pictures.[52][53] King Arthur: Legend of the Sword received mixed\\nreviews from critics and the subsequent sequels were cancelled.[54][55]\\nIn August 2017, Ritchie received the Raindance Auteur Award for his contributions to the British film\\nindustry.[56] Next, Ritchie directed Disney\\'s live-action adaptation of Aladdin (2019), based on the 1992\\nanimated film of the same name.[57] The plot follows Aladdin, a street urchin, as he falls in love with\\nPrincess Jasmine, befriends a Genie, and battles the wicked Jafar.

Anton Bitel of Sight & Sound  wrote that it \"returns to the sense and sensibilities of\\nhis earliest features\".[63] Film critic James Berardinelli gave the film 31⁄2 out of four stars, writing, \"The\\nGentlemen takes Ritchie back to his roots\" although  \"the screenplay is too clever by half, with some of the\\nquirkiness being awkward and intrusive.\"[64] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film gained an approval rating of\\n74% based on 260 r eviews,[65] and earned $115 m illion w orldwide.[66]\\nRitchie next directed the action thriller Wrath of Man, a remake of the 2004 film Cash Truck, starring Jason\\nStatham, which was released in theatres in the United States on May 7, 2021.[67][68][69] It was initially set\\nfor theatrical release in the United Kingdom  by Lionsgate UK, but was instead released straight to\\nstreaming on Amazon Prime Video on D ecember 10, 2021.[70]\\nRitchie followed up Wrath of Man with the spy thriller Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre, again starring\\nStatham.[71][72] It was scheduled for release in theatres on March 18, 2022, but was pulled from the\\nschedule a month prior without an explanation.[73] In February 2021, Ritchie signed on to direct and write\\nthe World War II film The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, based on the book by Damien Lewis, for\\nproduc er Jerry Bruckheimer and Paramount Pictures.[74] In October 2022, Henry Cavill and Eiza González\\nwere cast in the lead roles, with Paramount no longe r involved.[75]\\nRitchie began filming his next film, a war drama titled The Covenant starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Dar Salim,\\nAntony Starr and Emily Beecham, in February 2022 in Alicante, Spain.[76][77] The film was released in\\ntheatres in the United States on April 21, 2023.[78] In June of that year, it was announc ed that Ritchie had\\nsigned on to direct a live-action film adaptation of Disney\\'s Hercules.[79] In May 2023, a few weeks after\\nproduc tion wrapped on The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, it was announc ed Ritchie would next\\ndirect an as-yet untitled action film starring Cavill, Gyllenhaal and González, set to shoot in Spain in the\\nsummer of 2023.[80]\\nRitchie has cited Quentin Tarantino and Sergio Leone as influences on his work. However, he has stated\\n\"just about every film — a ny good f ilm — that\\'s ever been made has had an influence on m e. But then how\\nmuch of it, I have no idea\".[81] He has complimented several films including The Long Good Friday\\n(1980) , The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1966), Seven Samurai (1954) and Once Upon a Time in the\\nWest (1968) .[81] When asked about the influence of criminals Ronald and Reginald Kray, Ritchie states\\n\"It\\'s inevitable ... everything, more or less, of the old-school villainy related back to the Krays at some\\npoint. And the Krays were a lot worse than everyone  thinks they are. ... And I know what those boys  were\\ndoing w as a hundr ed times worse than what everyone  thought  was going on. S o it\\'s inevitable that anything\\nthat is genuine, and ol d, and B ritish will somehow have something to do w ith the Krays\".[81]\\nRitchie\\'s films often incorporate memorable and \"colourful\" characters, for instance, Irish boxe r Mickey\\nO\\'Neil in Snatch, and crime boss \"Hatchet\" Harry in Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. In his crime\\nfilms, there is also fragmented dialogue , with many characters behaving menacingly and using cockney\\nslang.[82][83] The portrayal of the British class system has also been explored.[84] Costume designer for The\\nGentlemen, Michael Wilkinson, said \"Each character has an iconic, memorable look — a little larger than\\nlife\".[82]Filmmaking\\nInfluences and style', metadata={'source': '/content/ritchie.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content='Ritchie with then-wife Madonna, 2005Fast-paced and energetic action scenes serve as cinematic choices, as well as placing his characters in\\ncombat or violent situations.[85] Ritchie has used fast-cutting and slow motion to build momentum in the\\nstory, and to create a high-impact viewing experience, respectively. He is also know n to use interweaving\\nstories and a non-linear narrative such as a circular plot in his films; this is found in the case of Lock, Stock,\\nand T wo Sm oking Barrels, Sherlock Holmes and Snatch [83][86]\\nRitchie has said this on hi s creative process:\\nMy creative process has never been something I can put into words. It\\'s very random , very\\nscattered and can sometimes lead down dark alleyways and dead ends. What I will say is I\\nthink any director needs to immerse himself in both real life and in history to fully open up\\ncreative processes. And you must be prepared for the reality that any creative process worth its\\nsalt needs to be revised, reworked and, on oc casion, thrown out  the window  entirely.[87]\\nRitchie has worked multiple times with Vinnie Jones, Jason Statham, Jason Flemyng, Alan Ford, Geoff\\nBell, Mark Strong, Jude Law, Eddie Marsan, Jared Harris, Charlie Hunna m, Josh Hartnett, Hugh Grant,\\nJake Gyllenhaal, and Henry Cavill.\\nRitchie started training in Shotokan karate at the age of seven at the\\nBudokw ai in London , where he later achieved a black belt in both\\nShotokan and Judo.[88] He also has a black belt in Brazilian Jiu-\\nJitsu unde r Renzo Gracie.[89]\\nIn an interview, Ritchie revealed that he can speak Hebrew.[90]\\nOn 18 May 2000, Ritchie was arrested by police for allegedly\\nassaulting a 20-year-old man outside the Kensington home he\\nshared with American singer-songw riter Madonna .[91] On 22\\nDecember 2000, Ritchie married Madonna  at Skibo Castle in\\nScotland.[92] Madonna  gave birth to their son, Rocco (born 11\\nAugust 2000 in Los Angeles) and adopted a Malawian baby in\\n2006, D avid (born 24 S eptember 2005) .[93]\\nMadonna  filed for divorce in October 2008, citing irreconcilable differences.[94] On 15 December 2008,\\nMadonna \\'s spoke swoman announc ed that she had agreed to a divorce settlement with Ritchie, the terms of\\nwhich grant him £50–60 million, which includes the value of the couple\\'s London pub and Wiltshire estate\\nin England.
